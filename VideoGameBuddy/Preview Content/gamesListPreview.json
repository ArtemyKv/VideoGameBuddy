With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link learns that this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.",
        "summary": "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the second major installment in The Legend of Zelda series and the direct sequel to the first game. Like its predecessor, it features dungeons that must be located in the overworld and searched for an item that will prove useful. However, the game presents many very important gameplay changes compared to the previous one, affecting especially the movements and the combat. Moving around the world map involves encounters with enemies that take place on a side-scrolling playfield rather than the top-down perspective for which the series became known."

Eventually, they kidnap Princess Zelda and lock her in a dungeon which can only be opened with the Triforce. Each of the dragons is located in their own labyrinth, and each guards a different fragment of the Triforce. Link sets out to destroy all eight dragons and reassemble the Triforce to free Zelda from the dragons' dungeon. Once Link defeats the last dragon, he reassembles the Triforce and frees Zelda from her prison.",
        "summary": "Zelda is a multiscreen Game & Watch game that was only released in English as a stand-alone system pre-loaded with the single game. It has dual screens which fold in a clamshell design, similar to the Nintendo DS. It was re-released as part of the Nintendo Mini Classics line in 1998 and 2007. The complete game can also be unlocked in Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance and Wii U Virtual Console.\n\nIts core formula is based on that of the original The Legend of Zelda, where Link must fight through eight dungeons and obtain the eight shards of the Triforce of Wisdom. However, it bears more gameplay similarities to The Adventure of Link, since it is 2D and from a side-on perspective. The game features an original, though minimal storyline."

It appears that a mysterious man has cursed the tree, and Link is sent to the Hyrule Castle to find out more. Princess Zelda tells Link that Ganondorf, the leader of the Gerudo tribe, seeks to obtain the Triforce, a holy relic that grants immense power to the one who possesses it. Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule.",
        "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the fifth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series and the first to be released for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex."

But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link!",

Because of its single-player elements, Four Swords Adventures is also the first game in the series to allow a single player to control more than one Link at once, and it utilizes various methods to allow the player to make use of the four Links, such as formations. Also it is the only title to break locations and temples up into succinct, separate stages and levels which can be replayed even after beating them once. The game itself, though an innovation in Zelda gameplay, is heavily inspired by the music, graphics, and locations of A Link to the Past."

After the battle, people built a shrine to protect it. Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword and asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away. Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky. In an attempt to recuse Zelda, Link dragged the Four Sword and it created three more Links! The Links then began their adventure to save Zelda.",

A month passes without word from the King, so Zelda sends Link to find him but he too goes missing. Zelda ventures off to Gamelon to find both Link and the King, accompanied by her elderly nursemaid Impa.",
        "summary": "Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon was the product of a compromise between Nintendo and Philips following their failure to release a CD-ROM based add-on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed in tandem with Link: The Faces of Evil and marks the first game where the eponymous princess Zelda is playable. The Wand of Gamelon differ from most conventional Zelda games as it is a platformer with a side-scrolling view, similar to The Adventure of Link. Stages are accessed from a world map, with more becoming available as Zelda clears an area or defeats a boss. The game have been subject to much criticism and Nintendo does not recognize it as part of the series."

Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword and asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away. Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky. In an attempt to recuse Zelda, Link dragged the Four Sword and it created three more Links! The Links then began their adventure to save Zelda.",

Shortly afterward, Tatl joins Link and agrees to help him revert to his native form. A meeting with a wandering mask salesman reveals that the Skull Kid is wearing Majora's Mask, an ancient item used in hexing rituals, which calls forth a menacing moon hovering over the land of Termina.

Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games. It also includes a time system that spans three days, and this cycle must be reset periodically to progress through the game."
